Spatial Audio Simulator
=======================


A HTML5 application that simulates how audio spatialisation influences in human hearing.
------------------------------------------------------------


The Spatial Audio Simulator implements a virtualization of the effects that a movement in a audio source position or its orientation influences in human hearing.
In difference to a physical experimentation, the Spatial Audio Simulator is a very intuitive application and doesn’t need advanced setup and/or knowledge in audio spatialisation to be executed. **The use of stereo headphones is recommended.**

How does it works:
--------

1. Manually:

* *Dragging:* Click and drag objects in the screen to your wanted position relative to the listener or drag him  

The application can be used by manually dragging objects around the screen, which simulates how the position of the object manipulated influences in the audio heard in the microphone  simulates the real world listener and audio sources
